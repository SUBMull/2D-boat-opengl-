# 2D-boat-opengl-
Simple 2D boat  , with simple animation and an interaction!
using c++ and glut library.
i divided the code to be on three levels to make it clear! 
first step i started with simple, basic drawing for a boat
then i added light and material depth with smooth shading ,
lastly i made the program interactive by creating menus and using special keys.
